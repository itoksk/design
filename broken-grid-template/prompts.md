# Broken Grid Design Prompts

## 基本プロンプト

### レイアウト生成
```
Create a broken grid layout that intentionally violates traditional design rules. Elements should:
- Overlap and collide with each other
- Be placed at random angles and positions
- Have varying sizes without logical hierarchy
- Create visual tension through misalignment
- Use asymmetric balance rather than symmetry
- Include unexpected white space and dense clusters
- Feature elements that appear to be falling or floating
```

### カラースキーム生成
```
Design a chaotic color palette that:
- Combines unexpected color combinations
- Uses jarring contrasts and clashing hues
- Includes sudden bursts of bright colors against muted backgrounds
- Features random color assignments without pattern
- Mixes analogous and complementary colors randomly
- Creates visual noise through color vibration
- Employs both monochrome and vivid sections unpredictably
```

### タイポグラフィ生成
```
Create typography that breaks conventional rules:
- Mix multiple typefaces within single words
- Use random font sizes without hierarchy
- Apply varying rotations to individual letters
- Combine serif, sans-serif, and decorative fonts chaotically
- Feature overlapping text blocks
- Include upside-down or mirrored text
- Employ extreme kerning and leading variations
- Create illegible but visually interesting text arrangements
```

```

### Scattered Navigation
```
Create a navigation system that abandons traditional menu structures:

```

### Chaos Form
```
Create a form that challenges user expectations:
- Input fields at random angles
- Varying field sizes without logic
- Labels disconnected from inputs
- Submit button in unexpected location
- Form elements that overlap
- Fields that appear to be hand-drawn
- Validation messages in random positions
- Progress indicators that move backwards
```

- Elements following cursor with delay
- Cursor revealing hidden content
```

### Scroll Mayhem
```
Design scroll behaviors that break conventions:
- Non-linear scroll progression
- Elements moving at different scroll speeds

- Random content injection during scroll
- Scroll direction affecting layout rotation
```

### Click Anarchy
```
Implement click interactions that defy expectations:
- Clicks causing element fragmentation
- Random outcomes for each click
